##2. Next, the school counselor was curious whether the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country. Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with Î± = 0.05. 1

country_schools_IQ <- c(100)

#t.test
t.test(y, 
       country_schools_IQ = country_schools_IQ,

       var.equal = FALSE, 
       alternative = "two.sided", 
       conf.level = 0.05) 

#2. answer is 98.44
