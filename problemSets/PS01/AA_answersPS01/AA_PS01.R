y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)


##1. Find a 90% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.
CI_lower <- qnorm(0.05, 
                  mean = mean(y), 
                  sd = (sd(y)/sqrt(length(y))) # the equation for the standard error of the mean
)
CI_upper <- qnorm(0.95,
                  mean = mean(y),
                  sd = (sd(y)/sqrt(length(y)))
)

matrix(c(CI_lower, CI_upper), ncol = 2,
       dimnames = list("",c("Lower", "Upper")))


##2. Next, the school counselor was curious whether the average student IQ in her school 
#is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.
#Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with Î± = 0.05. 1
