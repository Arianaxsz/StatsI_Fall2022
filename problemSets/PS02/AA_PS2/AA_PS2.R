#Question 1 
# (a) Calculate the χ2 test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do ”by hand” in R).


#(b) Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in R).2 What do you conclude if α = 0.1?
##2Remember frequency should be > 5 for all cells, but let’s calculate the p-value here anyway.

#(c) Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.
